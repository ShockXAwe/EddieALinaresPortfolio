                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi there!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for coming to my page, I suppose you want to know a little about me since you clicked on the
                    "About
                    me" link above. Lets see what can I say...
                </p>
                <p>
                    For starters I'm currently enrolled in Northwestern Professional Schools for web developement. I
                    been in
                    the
                    professional tech field for a little over 11 years now and love it.
                    Since i was younger I was always into gadgets and technology. One of the biggest influences had to
                    be
                    video
                    games. I loved playing them when I was younger, and I still do till this day!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from technology, I enjoy working out (boxing), Djing at clubs/bars, driving my Evolution X,
                    and
                    riding my Ducati during summers. I would say that I'm definately a city guy. Born and raised in
                    Chicago,
                    IL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every year for the last 3 years I go to Blizzcon out in Anehiem California. As I mentioned earlier I
                    love
                    gaming, specifically PC gaming. Yes I do have a crazy built computer at home (2 of them to be
                    exact).
                    Blizzcon hosts the Overwatch World Championships every year, that being said, Overwatch is my number
                    1
                    game
                    of choice that I play.
                    After attending Blizzcon and researching the company Blizzard, I realized that my dream is to work
                    at
                    Blizzard Entertainment. Call it a long shot but it certainly is something I'm really aiming towards
                    with
                    a
                    passion.
                    I hope after completeing this course and building up my experience throughout the time at my current
                    place
                    of employment, that dream will become a reality!
                </p>
